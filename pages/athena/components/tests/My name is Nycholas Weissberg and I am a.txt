Human: What is a meme, and what's the history behind this word?
Robot: A meme is a cultural idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a society. The word "meme" was first used in the 1960s by Richard Dawkins to describe an idea that could be passed from one individual to another within a culture. The concept of the meme was later popularized by internet culture, where it has been used to describe the rapid spread of images, videos, and other forms of content that are shared and altered by users. The history of the word "meme" is closely tied to the history of internet culture and the way that it has influenced the way that people communicate and share ideas.
