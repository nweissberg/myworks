  - name: The Fool
    bio: The Fool is at the beginning of his spiritual and magical journey. The Fool is young, open, and daring enough to take a risk and make a leap of faith. He strolls along at the very edge of the cliff, with a green valley below him and mountains at his back, either unaware or uncaring of the risk. He carries a leather satchel filled with his past experiences on his traveler's staff. These are kept safe and secure by his faith, symbolized by the pentagram that keeps the satchel closed. His bright, colorful costume gives a nod to both his happy mood and his sunny disposition. The red feather in his cap symbolizes his zeal for life and his love of the journey. The Fool has his face tipped up to the bright blue sky and is enjoying the freedom, excitement, and adventure of his journey. The white rosebud that the Fool carries symbolizes his innocence, his trust, and those new beginnings. The dog portrayed in this card is the Fool's companion and familiar. It prances happily alongside him. West Highland White Terriers (or "Westies," as they are often called) are known for being loyal, energetic, and smart dogs, a perfect companion for the novice traveler.
    info: This first Major Arcana card is an excellent illustration of someone who is following their bliss. This card often materializes more in a reading when the querent is trying something new and completely different. They may be just beginning their spiritual journey or are exploring a new magical tradition or path. Perhaps they are taking on a brand new job or are considering an innovative business opportunity. The Fool encourages us to dare, be more open-minded, and enjoy the ride. Do not let yourself be dragged down by worries. The Fool laughingly persuades you to trust and take a chance, and not fret too much about the future. Instead, just enjoy the trip and take things one day at a time. This card is all about the proverbial leap of faith. Sure, it is possible that you might make a mistake or fall down, but hey, you can always get right back up, brush yourself off, and try again. Sometimes that is the best way to learn, by daring to do. At the end of the day, the Fool encourages you to be open to new prospects and ideas. Live on the edge, think outside of the box. Be confident and bold! There is a big, wide, magical world out there. Go explore it!
    keys: Follow your bliss. Adventure, fresh starts, exploration, a journey. New ideas; take a chance and chase your dreams. The beginning of a spiritual quest, exploring a new magical path or tradition. A leap of faith.
    gods: [none, because the Fool represents humanity, null]
    astro: uranus
    reversed: Irresponsibility, recklessness, dangerous and careless behavior. A precarious situation. There is a need to be cautious and plan ahead.
  
  - name: The Magician
    bio: >
      The Magician stands behind an altar at dawn with his personal emblem around his neck and magical symbols embroidered on his robe. With the wand in his hand, he draws a lemniscate, the infinity symbol, in the air above him, reminding us that "As within, so without." With his other hand, he points down to the earth to illustrate another classic magical proverb: "As above, so below."
      On the altar lie the classic Witch's stools, which are also symbols of the four suits of the Minor Arcana: the cup to represent the element of water, the sword for air, the hawthorn wand for fire, and the golden pentacle for the element of earth. The Magician is a commander of the four natural elements. By combining his personal power with the natural elements, he makes magic through the sheer force of his will.
      He stands beneath a bower of red roses, which represents harmony. The four lilies in the foreground symbolize the purity of his relationship with deity and his creativity. The four fairies in the card represent each of the four natural elements: the green fairy for earth, red for fire, blue for water, and yellow for air. The fairies fluttering around the Magician's altar show us how intimately connected he is to and has a strong working relationship with the elementals and the awesome powers of the natural world.
    info: >
      When this card appears in a reading, it is a message to tap into your own magic to find the answers you seek. Work in balance with the elements and the powers of nature to create your own positive change. The Major Arcana card challenges you to seek out the magic and bring about positive change. Magic is all around you and it is everywhere in the natural world. Connect to this elemental energy and tap into its powers. Be confident and look within as well as without.
      This particular Major Arcana card is a lesson in the Hermetic Principle of Correspondence, which teaches us that "as above, so below; as within, so without." We do exist on all planes - the astral/spiritual, the energetic, and the physical. The Magician urges you to choose the most harmonious tools and natural accessories for your magic. Use the laws of correspondence and all of the resources that you have at your disposal wisely.
    keys: As above, so below. Skill, determination, connection, confidence. Strength of will. Working magic with the four elements and the elemental spirits. The Hermetic principle of Correspondence. Elemental magic and personal power.

    astro: mercury
    reversed: Lack of confidence, poor communication with others, manipulative magic.

  - name: The High Priestess
    bio: The High Priestess before you is powerful, mystical, wise, and compelling. She is serious, kind, just, and compassionate. This is the Maiden aspect of the Goddess, and her wisdom is all-encompassing. The High Priestess wears an ethereal silver gown and a royal blue hooded cape as she sits in contemplation upon her throne, her feline familiar sitting calmly at her side. The blue sky and nature are her backdrop, and the moon and the stars of the cosmos are at her feet. Pomegranates grow lushly around her, and she is stationed evenly between the two lunar pillars. The High Priestess is calm and in control of the occult powers she wields. She does not lean towards the waxing energies or towards the waning energies of the moon, as she is not inclined to the light or the dark. The High Priestess is centered and neutral. She wears a Triple Goddess crown and a necklace of amber and jet stones to denote her rank. Amber increases mental power and jet enhances psychic abilities, both important qualities for the High Priestess. In her hands, she holds a scroll for knowledge and blooming sage, which represents wisdom. The pomegranates are sacred to the goddess Persephone, and they signify royalty and elegance. The young black cat, the classic Witch's familiar, represents the feminine mysteries of the Craft.
    info: When this card appears in a reading, it often marks a time of initiation and learning. The Maiden Goddess is challenging you. Be wise and listen to her words of wisdom. This card is a reminder to quietly and calmly seek occult knowledge and look within. Use your intuition and trust your instincts. This is not the time to let your emotions rule you; instead, it is an opportunity for growth and a chance to gain real insight and understanding. The High Priestess teaches you to be strong, wise, and steady. She quietly shows you that in order to attain real wisdom, you must remember to always work your magic thoughtfully and from a place of neutrality.

  - name: The Empress
    bio: The Empress is seated on a cushioned golden throne surrounded by nature. Her throne is embellished with patterns of five-petaled roses and wheat. The five-petaled flower creates a natural pentagram, and the flowers and sheaves of wheat link her back to the ancient mother goddesses Demeter and Isis. The Empress is pregnant in this card, indicating her fertility. She is the great Mother Goddess, and the twelve stars that form a halo around her head represent the signs of the zodiac. She holds in her hand a scepter, denoting her power over all of the natural world. The beautiful Empress wears a rich green gown, another link to the powers of life, growth, and nature. The nine pearls around the Empress's throat symbolize the nine classic planets, and pearls are a symbol for basic organic creativity. A heart-shaped copper shield with a stylized venus symbol rests to the side of her throne. This card has the astrological Association of the planet venus, and copper is the metal associated with that planet. The Empress's shield reminds us to protect and cherish the love in our lives. The lush forests, green grass, and the river that cascades down the slope are more depictions of sacred feminine symbolism. The background sky with the heavy gray clouds holds the promise of rain and life coming to the land. The wildflowers and wheat growing in the foreground of the scene correspond to the abundance of the harvest, and they represent prosperity and resources. Finally, the rabbit that sits contentedly at the Empress's feet is another nod to the energy and awesome powers of fertility, creation, and nature.
    info: This is the Motherhood, fertility, and power of nature card. When this card appears in a reading, it is a message from the Mother Goddess to respect the force and power of nature and the body's ability to reproduce. If the Empress card appears in a reading along with the Ace of Wands or the Ace of Cups, then it symbolizes pregnancy or that conception may be likely at this time. This card can also indicate an opportunity to bring new, creative ideas into the world. Protect and cherish the loving relationships in your life. Focus on your family and your home, and enjoy the energy and excitement your children bring into your life. "Birth" your new ideas. Embrace creativity and your own sexuality, and work joyously and respectfully with the powers of nature.
    keys: The Mother aspect of the Goddess, bringing new ideas into existence, feminine power, love, sexuality, motherhood, fertility, birth, creativity, Hearth and home, protecting love in your life, full moon magic, the power of nature.

  - name: The Emperor
    bio: The wise Emperor watches over his children as they play happily in the background. To denote his power, he holds a scepter topped by an ankh in his right hand, and in his left hand, he holds a globe. He wears a purple cape to represent his sovereignty. The mountains behind him symbolize his strength and steadfastness. The Emperor is surveying the scene and considering his options and plans for the future. He is a wise, kind ruler and a loving father figure. This card has the astrological Association of aries, which is represented by the ram's heads in the carved arms of the throne and the aries symbol on the Emperor's armor. This is the masculine characteristic of deity, the God aspect, and the divine father. The purple tulips in the foreground symbolize loyalty, while the blooming sorrel growing at his feet represents parental affection. Interestingly, the Emperor has no weapons and instead uses the power of his wisdom and experience to rule and keep the peace.
    info: This card may symbolize a leader of a family or a magical group who is responsible, a balanced person. Just as the Emperor is doing in this card, you should calmly survey your situation and carefully consider your options. This card may stand for your boss at work (no matter what their gender), not just a husband or a father. The Emperor card will often appear in a reading when you are up for a promotion at work, about to earn a higher degree in your coven, or even if you are taking a new job with better prospects. If you find yourself standing as the head of the family or coven and are the peacemaker and arbitrator, it is possible this card may represent your role within the group. It can also symbolize your leadership within a family dynamic or at your place of employment.
    keys: Leader of a family or coven, Father figure, family man, loving husband and/or father, sovereignty, reason, masculine energy, protection, a responsible and balanced person.
    gods: [Osiris, Zeus, jupiter, Divine Father]

  - name: The High_Priests
    bio: High Priests sits on a stone bench at the temple. He is an elegant older gentleman, one of the Wise Ones. He wears a rich, flowing, regal scarlet robe, and his silver pentagram, a symbol of magical power and personal protection, is displayed proudly upon his chest. The position of his right hand, two fingers up and two fingers down, and the wooden staff he holds in his left hand are classic tarot symbols. They represent balance between the worlds of the physical and the spiritual. The three cross pieces of the staff correspond to the upper world, the middle world, and the underworld. In the background, we see mountains and a lush natural setting. In the foreground, a long shadow is cast. Two large skeleton keys hover in the air before the High Priest. These two prominent skeleton keys represent the divine feminine and the divine masculine, represented by the moon with its silver lunar key and the sun with its golden solar key, respectively. One of the many names for this card is the Hierophant. The High Priest is an authority figure, a counselor, and the keeper of magical traditions and knowledge.
    info: When this card appears in a reading, it means that there are questions that need answering and advice to be sought. Classically, this card denotes a need for legal advice or counseling. It may also indicate a course of study or furthering your education, or the need to settle disputes in a covenant. But remember that the High Priest is the wise and patient counselor, an elder, and a teacher. He does not give you all the answers to your questions. Instead, he helps guide you where to look to find your own truths. He places in your hands the keys to unlock the mysteries and to gain deeper knowledge, then trusts that you will find the answers yourself, using the lessons he has carefully taught you.
    keys: Legal matters, Counseling, Dispute settlement in a coven, Upholding tradition, Preserving magical wisdom, Understanding the mysteries of the Craft, Furthering your education, Uncovering personal truths.
    gods: [Horus, jupiter, Mithras, the Sage]

  - name: The Lovers
    bio: >
      Lovers share an intimate moment in a ring garden filled with blooming trees and a stream. Above and behind the couple, coming out of the clouds, an angel watches over them. The sun illuminates the winged angel, and the angel is reaching out and blessing the bond between the couple in a shower of beautiful, glowing light. Representing harmony and messages, the angel gently reminds us that love enlightens and heals.
      The couple is on the verge of a kiss. Romance is in the air, and once the couple does kiss, their emotional commitment begins, and their destinies will forever be intertwined. They are about to discover whether they have chosen well.
      The Lovers card is a card of choices made and romance. It is a wonderful illustration of the balance of opposites and the power of attraction. Classically, the man represents reason, and the woman symbolizes emotions. The woman wears a rosy "pink gown", the color of love and soft, happy emotions. She has six pink roses in her red hair, and the six roses are a nod to the number of this card, which symbolizes a balance of opposites.
      Pink roses, in particular, stand for romantic love. In bloom at the couple's feet are daffodils and hyacinths. These magical flowers add the enchantment of chivalry and new love to the meaning of this card.
    info: The Lovers is a card of relationships and choice. This card illustrates the power of love, desire, destiny, romance, and attraction. It celebrates challenges overcome so that two lovers can be together. The angel in this Major Arcana card may be thought of as a matchmaker, but she may also be a protective force for the couple. The angel is a symbol of destiny. She is there to show us how every choice we make can affect our future. The angel reminds us to choose wisely.
    keys: Sexual love, beauty, romantic relationship, decisions, commitment, choices to be made, love heals.
    gods: [[Eros, Psyche], [Isis, Osiris]].
    zodiac: gemini
    reversed: Relationship issues, poor choices made, ignoring problems, spats and squabbles.
  
  - name: The Chariot
    bio: The knight is clad in his gold and silver chariot as he races his horses through the clouds and across the sky. In the background, we see a crescent moon, starry skies, and the sunrise's lighter sky beneath them. On the charioteer's helmet is a star pointed upward, the star of venus, a symbol of healing. Across his armor is a golden sash bearing the signs of the zodiac. He holds a magician's wand aloft in his left hand and appears to be directing the two horses that are pulling the chariot with the strength of his will alone, as there are no reins on the horses. This illustrates that he is in control of his personal power and the magical energy at play. The Chariot tells the story of the hero who has battled fiercely and won. This is the only card in the deck that has two horses in it, and their symbolism is important. This pair of horses mimics the pillars in the High Priestess card. To the driver's right is a black horse, which represents night, lunar magic, chaos, the subconscious, and feminine energies. The white horse on the driver's left symbolizes the day, solar magic, order, the conscious mind, and masculine energies. Rather than being ruled by those forces, the charioteer directs them and harnesses these powers to create the outcome that he desires, just as we see him controlling the pair of horses and keeping them moving forward together.
    info: This is a card that speaks of hard-won victories. The Chariot card is all about self-confidence, control, motivation, and the determination to succeed. Tap into your own personal power and you will see your goals manifest. Obstacles and blocks will be removed. Work magic for movement and change. When the Chariot comes roaring into a reading, it is a message to combine your magic with mental discipline and tenacity. Power comes from within. Believe in yourself, combined with determination, focus, and willpower, and you will succeed. In the Major Arcana, only the Chariot, the High Priestess, and the Star cards have starry skies. These three cards are linked. If the High Priestess appears in a reading with the Chariot, it is a sign that victory can be obtained through wisdom. If the Star appears in a reading with the Chariot, it is a sign that the victory will bring emotional healing.
    keys: Willpower, ambition, focus, drive, leadership abilities. Tap into your personal power to see your magic manifest. Overcome adversity and any obstacles in your path. Don't give up, hang in there!
    gods: [Apollo, Artemis, Helios]
    zodiac: cancer
    reversed: No willpower, no drive, lack of focus or ambition, fear of commitment.
  
  - name: Strength
    bio: >
      In this card, a woman calmly leans into a lion for comfort, smiling and able to control the animal by her demeanor and touch alone. The woman is crowned with green oak leaves, representing strength, while a glowing infinity symbol floats above her head, indicating that she is a spiritual and magical being.
      Her gown is white and red, both colors associated with the goddess, and around her neck are bright rubies. The number of these fiery stones is a reminder and a link to the number of her Major Arcana card. The necklace is an important symbol for the woman in the card, as rubies are known for enhancing a positive and courageous state of mind.
      A garland of lush red roses, signifying harmony and beauty, drapes over the lion and the woman, linking them together and bringing up the question of who has strength in this card. Is it the woman, for her quiet strength, power, and enjoyment of the situation? Or the lion, for being strong enough to tame his wilder impulses, to have self-control, and to allow himself the pleasure of the experience?
    info: Gentle strength, calmness, fortitude, and quiet personal power are the themes of this card. When this card appears in a reading, it is a reminder that brute force is not necessary in the current situation. However, the wise use of personal power, self-control, determination, and strength of character are. Sometimes the strongest thing we can do is to have confidence in ourselves and our personal power to be strong enough to work calmly and with determination through any challenges we may face, carefully and in complete control of ourselves.
    keys: Strength of character, personal power, restraint, being calm, self-control, confidence, determination.
    gods: [Apollo, Helios]
    zodiac: leo
    reversed: Feeling helpless, inhibition, fear, doubt, control issues.
  
  - name: The Hermit
    bio: An old, wise wizard is on a vision quest. Perhaps he is Merlin; He has isolated himself, gone off alone, and has hurled himself to the test to uncover the mysteries. He wears a classic wizard's cloak covered with moons and stars, but the cloak is old, faded, and a bit ragged at the edges, showing us that he has been traveling for a while. Under the twilight sky, a desolate, now ice-covered mountain range appears behind him, symbolizing his separation from the rest of the world. The Hermit uses his traveler's staff to help him on his journey. In his right hand, he holds a soft, old metal lantern with a glowing six-pointed star held inside to light his way. A six-pointed star symbolizes the balance between masculine and feminine energies. The Hermit's glowing star also reminds us to seek our spiritual truths both within and without. The star represents the wisdom that we all hold within. When this is allowed to shine forth, wondrous things can happen. If we have the strength, we can travel to the top of the mountain, gaining insight and seeing his light for ourselves. The Hermit gains experience through his trials and tests, and he reminds us that we can do the same. Knowledge, inspiration, and enlightenment can be ours.
    info: The Hermit card is all about taking purposeful time off, standing alone, and looking within. When this card appears in a reading, it is a sign that you need to take some downtime for yourself and regroup. Now is the time for vision questioning, reflection, intuition, meditation, and self-development. It is time to work your magic solitarily for a while, even if you are a member of a coven. Trust in yourself and in your gut hunches, and take some personal time to see where this leads you. Let your magic light the way no matter what challenges you are facing.
    keys: Reflection, meditation, intuition. Taking time off from the coven. Solitary work, spending some time alone out in nature, gaining enlightenment.
    gods: [Hermes the Traveler, saturn]
    zodiac: virgo
    reversed: Feeling isolated or unable to cope with problems on your own. Loneliness. Time to seek out a new circle or coven.

  - name: Wheel of the Year
    bio: A silver, lunar pentagram is surrounded by the eight spoken, golden, solar wheel of the year. In the background, we see bright blue skies and soft clouds. This card evokes the magic and mystery of the Wheel of the Year, all eight Sabbats, and the four seasons and cycles of nature. The four seasons and their corresponding tarot suits are illustrated together. The earth element is represented by the pentacle and the winter solstice with holly, the classic Yuletide plant. In magical herbalism, holly is used for good luck and protection. In the bottom right, we see pink cherry blossoms for the spring equinox together with the sword, which are both associated with the element of air. The cherry blossoms, a classic spring flowering tree, signify nobility and chivalry. In the bottom left corner, there are vibrant green oak leaves for the summer solstice and the blooming hawthorn wand from our deck. Both the wand and the season of summer correspond beautifully with the element of fire. Here, the foliage of the midsummer oak represents health, wisdom, virtue, and long life. Finally, in the upper left-hand corner of the card, we see an enchanting mixture of beautiful orange maple leaves in the autumn combined with acorns for the harvest. The cups suit is aligned with the autumn season, as autumn is linked to the element of water. The maple leaves symbolize elegance, beauty, and energy, while the acorns bring prosperity and wisdom.
    info: This card symbolizes the magic of the four seasons and the energies of the Wheel of the Year. When this card turns up in a reading, it is a message to work with the energies and the cycles of nature that are currently around you, and not against them. This means rest and introspection in the winter, new beginnings, growth, and opportunities in the spring, energy, excitement, bounty, and vibrancy in the summer, and abundance and reminders to prepare, gather, and remember in the autumn. Expect there to be change, as all of life is forever transforming and growing. This card classically represents good luck, opportunity, and a fortuitous event.
    keys: The Wheel of the Year, celebrating the sabbats and esbats, good luck, working with the energies and magic of each season.
    gods: [Fortuna, Arianrhod]
    astro: jupiter
    reversed: Period of bad luck, feeling disconnected from the seasons and rhythms of nature, seasonal affective disorder (winter time blues).
  
  - name: Justice
    bio: >
      The Greek goddess of justice, Themis, sits at her temple. She looks at you carefully with a direct and thoughtful gaze. Themis holds a double-edged sword in her right hand, which symbolizes that balance must be preserved, even if it is by force. In her left hand, Themis holds the scales, which are also equally balanced. The emeralds in her crown and the emerald brooch pinned on her cape promote emotional stability and encourage wisdom. No one can see through the purple curtain behind her, as it conceals the mysteries and inner workings of the universe.
      This is the central card of the twenty-two Major Arcana cards, since justice is at the center of our lives and she will have her impartial outcome. Themis treats all with integrity and reverence, as she is, in essence, a neutral force. Justice reminds us of the laws of karma and the idea of cause and effect. What we have done in the past and do now in the present will affect our future. The Justice card illustrates equilibrium, balance, and fairness. It is time to weigh your options and assess your actions in life.
      The black-eyed Susans growing in the Grecian urns gently symbolize justice in the language of flowers. The Justice card is connected to both the High Priestess and the Karma Major Arcana cards. Like the High Priestess, Justice is a neutral force, and its links to the Karma card remind us that, in the end, karma will always have its way.
    info: When the Justice card appears in a reading, you need to ask yourself what is out of balance and what sort of justice you are looking for. What is it that seems so unfair in your life? What actions of yours have brought you to this point? This card can represent legal matters and a possible court case. It can also symbolize a restoration of balance. It indicates that fair play, honesty, harmony, and balance are coming. Situations will work themselves out. Trust and leave the dispensing of this justice in the hands of the gods.
    keys: Justice, legal matters, fair outcome to a court case, cause and effect, allowing the gods to take care of the outcome, honesty, equilibrium, integrity, and equality.
    gods: [Athena, Ma'at, Themis]
    zodiac: libra
    reversed: Bias, injustice, delays, unfair outcome.
  
  - name: The Hanged Man
    bio: >
      A man is calmly hanging upside down from his toe on an ash tree. While he hangs there, he is in a transitional state or undergoing an initiation of some kind. The halo around the Hanged Man's face shows him to be experiencing an epiphany. The peaceful skies in the background of this card tell you that this phase is not a time to fear. You need to let go of something old and hurtful in order to gain this new wisdom. Enjoy this new perspective and the in-between chapter of your life, and see what you discover.
      In the Norse Pagan tradition, the world tree Yggdrasil supports the entire universe. The raven is a totem to the god Odin, and the bird symbolizes initiation, secrets, and prophecy. Just as Odin hung on the world tree to gain the knowledge of the runes, the Hanged Man also finds his answers on the ash tree during this transitional phase of life. The raven holds a sparkling golden pentagram and looks down on the Hanged Man as if to ask what he is doing there. Perhaps this is his totem animal, and it is keeping the Hanged Man company during his transitional state. Ravens are magical, clever, and playful birds. They are attracted to sparkling and shiny objects and will cache them. The classic colors of red, green, yellow, and blues speak of balance within the four natural elements, and these colors make up the Hanged Man's costume. The runes embroidered around the neck of his shirt and decorating the trunk of the ash tree are a link back to Odin, the world tree.
    info: When this card appears in a reading, it suggests that you should look at things from a different perspective. Embrace the idea of initiation as a means to gain newer wisdom and a clearer spiritual path. Let go of the illusion of control, and turn things upside down to carefully examine the lessons before you. It's important to be patient and relaxed, as resisting change will only lead to more drama. Whether you are reading Tarot cards or Runes, it's essential to pay close attention to the signs and meditate on their lessons. Going through this initiatory or transitional phase calmly and with joy can help you uncover mysteries and gain a new outlook on life.
    keys: Initiation, transitional phase of life, relaxing and letting changes come, gaining a new perspective on a current situation, Rune magic.
    gods: Odin
    astro: neptune
    reversed: Feeling stuck and unable to let go or move forward.

  - name: Death
    bio: The Death card is one of the most misunderstood cards in the tarot deck. Rarely does it symbolize physical death; instead, what it announces is radical change in the querent's life. In this card, Death's skull is lit with a glowing fire. The skull is a symbol of human mortality, and it is the seat of the mind. The greenish-yellow flames represent the mind's energy and power. Death's armor is dark and well-used. His white horse has glowing eyes and a bridle with a skull and crossbones trim. Death carries a flag that announces transformation. The flag is emblazoned with the number thirteen, the number of full moons in a year, and the flower on the flag is a five-petaled white rose, symbolizing the natural cycles of life. The brilliant red skies of sunset in the background correspond to the close of the day and the close of one chapter in your life. A child stands before Death with an offering of a bouquet of white daisies bound together with ribbons in the Triple Goddess colors of white, red, and black. In the language of flowers, white daisies symbolize innocence. It is important to note that the child is looking up and facing Death while holding out the flowers. He is happy, trusting, and unafraid of this knight; he welcomes the change. The child represents hope.
    info: "This card represents change. In order for something new to grow, something old has to give way. This card often shows up in readings for pregnant women, which makes sense. Think about it, their way of life is about to change forever. Their lives are about to transform into something else, new and exciting. This card also symbolizes other important endings and beginnings in your life: birth, marriage, new job, leaving for college, moving, etc. Basically, one way of life is gone, allowing room for new beginnings and opportunities to emerge."
    keys: Transformation, change, endings, and beginnings, cycles of nature and of life.
    gods: [Hades, pluto, Hel]
    zodiac: scorpio
    reversed: Traumatic adjustment, delayed difficult change.
  
  - name: Temperance
    bio: The Greek goddess of the rainbow, Iris, faces forward and wears her white gown. A golden triangle is on the bodice, which signifies balance and creativity. Her gown flows softly around her, and one of Iris's feet is on land while the other dips in the water. Neither on shore nor in the water, she is in an enchanted location where she is in both worlds and in between places. In Iris's hands are two different goblets, and she calmly pours water from one goblet into another. The water flows magically out and about before ending up in the bottom goblet. There is an alchemical transformation taking place here; she is tempering the liquid in the goblets to find the right balance or mixture. Behind Iris, the clouds have parted in the sky, and a rainbow appears, representing hope, magic, and miracles. Around her on the green banks grow Iris flowers in several different colors. The enchanting Iris flowers symbolize "an eloquent message," which suits the messenger goddess they were named after.

  - name: The Shadow Side
    bio: The Shadow Side replaces the traditional Devil card. Witches don't identify with the concept of a Devil figure. The Shadow Side shows what happens when you let fear and panic take over. The card illustrates a couple cowering away from a shadowy and frightening figure. They are alone in a sinister forest, clearly ruled by their fear. The clothes of the man and woman are dark and dreary, representing their unhappiness at being in a dark place in their lives. The posture and expressions of the couple illustrate their fear and show that they have inadvertently given away their power to someone or something else. Running and hiding from the shadowy creature is not helping the couple, nor are they finding any comfort. Instead, they must turn and face their fears, and stop letting situations and people frighten, intimidate, or upset them. We all must walk through dark times now and again. The question is, are you going to rise to the occasion and defeat your fears? Will you face the challenging people in your life and deal with situations head-on, or will you whimper and fret about it? Face your adversaries and fight back with honor and integrity, and you will defeat those who challenge you.
    info: This card symbolizes that you are allowing someone else or a situation to have power over you. The old coven mate who left in high drama, the in-law from hell, or the bossy you cannot please. This is a person who can walk into a room and ruin your day because you let them. Break those chains and walk out of the shadows. Stop giving away your power and stand strong. What is important to remember is that you can break free of your reaction anytime you wish. It's time to embrace the shadow side of your personality and to really look your fears in the face. Come to terms with whatever is holding you back. Stop cowering. Work to find balance and courage.
    keys: Allowing another person to have power over you and your reactions, defending yourself from harmful magic, overcoming fear to emerge victorious.
    gods: [Pan, the Horned God, Volos]

  - name: The Tower
    bio: The Tower card illustrates that there has been a dramatic revelation or a sudden change of plans. Stormy, dark skies surround a tower that sits high on a cliff. Lightning snakes down from storm clouds and strikes the tower, knocking a crown off the top. Within the tower, a fire burns, which cleanses and transforms. Two figures fall from the tower and they are tumbling headfirst. This shows us that this event is completely out of their control. The tower symbolizes our ambitions, while the ruby-studded crown represents the ego. In magical traditions, rubies are used to intensify awareness. The lightning bolt in this scene represents that there is now a flash of insight, and the bright light of truth will illuminate any questionable situation. Blocks are being removed, and negative energy is finally being broken through. Transformation is occurring, and evaluation is necessary at this time. You are being forced out of your comfortable little world. Now you will have to deal with the aftermath.
    info: The Tower card is all about a shocking revelation or event that forever changes the way you see yourself and the people around you. This is not necessarily a negative thing. Now that all of that built-up pressure has been released from the Tower, the fire inside will both cleanse and transform it. Shocking secrets are uncovered. You may take a blow to the ego, but you will survive your tumble. Change is coming, and it's going to be dramatic. The spiritual blocks or obstacles you once faced are now removed. What you learn will end up being helpful in the long run.
    keys: Change of plans, revelation of secrets, upheaval, blow to the ego, situations coming to a head, reevaluation, dramatic change, removal of blocks in your spiritual path.

  - name: The Star
    bio: The Star Goddess stands naked at the water's edge, with one foot on land and the other in the water. Her arms are held out over both the water and the land, and she holds simple pottery jugs in each hand. One stream of water flows down to the earth, representing physical healing, while the water from the other jug flows back into the pool of water, symbolizing spiritual healing. A large star shines in the night sky, surrounded by seven smaller stars. Each star has eight rays shimmering out from it. The eight-rayed star is a symbol of healing and is an emblem of the goddess venus, whom the evening star was named after. The glowing stars depicted in this card remind you to follow your dreams, to work with the quiet tides and energies of the stars, and that wishes will be fulfilled at this time. Around the Star Goddess and on the banks grow blue forget-me-nots. The forget-me-not flowers, also sacred to the goddess venus, represent hope and love. Not unlike the Temperance card, the Star Goddess is working between the worlds in this depiction. To be "between" is one of the most magical of places. The sacred ibis bird standing on the log at the shore represents Thoth, an Egyptian god of divine wisdom and science. Thoth was the inventor of astronomy and was considered the patron of the art of magic.
    info: The Star is a card of hope, inner peace, creativity, and healing. When this beautiful, tranquil card turns up in a reading, it is a sign that physical and emotional healing is on the way. Have hope, follow your dreams, and your wishes will be granted. This card speaks of inspiration; your creativity will now be better than ever before. Let it fill you up and see where it leads you.

      Hecate, the goddess of the crossroads, stands at the foggy intersection with a torch raised high. Her silver hair flows in the breeze, and around her neck she wears a pendant featuring Hecate's Wheel. Three skeleton keys and a pentagram hang from her waist. Hecate Trivia, the goddess of the three ways or the crossroads, holds sway over the land, sea, and sky. She can appear in many guises, such as a beautiful maiden, a matron, or a crone and guide, as depicted here.
      A crone is a powerful woman who has acquired great knowledge in her lifetime, walks with wisdom, and wears her years beautifully. Hecate's trio of companion wolves represent the wild aspects of ourselves. Hecate was always accompanied by canines, both wild and domestic.
      The two yew trees in the background are sacred to Hecate, and the willow corresponds to both the element of water and lunar magic. Hecate shows us that there is more to be seen than what we first imagine, such as a crone who is beautiful instead of haggard and wizened. Magic is everywhere, even in the most unsuspecting of places. Look carefully now, what will Hecate and the light of the moon reveal to you?
    info: This is the card of the Crone Goddess, waning moon magic, intuition, and illusions. It may also represent a development of psychic powers. When this card appears in a reading, it reveals that people and situations are not always as they appear. The moonlight can be deceptive. What looks one way during the day may appear completely different under the shifting light of the moon. You need to look carefully at what you think you see. Call on your guides, totems, and Hecate to see past the fog and to recognize the truth. Use your psychic gifts and trust your intuition. Work magic with Hecate now to see through any illusions and for the gifts of foresight, wisdom, and protection.
    keys: The Crone aspect of the Goddess, waning moon magic, protection magic, seeing through what others would keep hidden, intuition, and the development of psychic powers, wisdom gained through years of life experiences.

They are a family unit: a woman, a man in the center, and their child. The family has gathered for a celebration of the eclipse. They stand before a magical circle where torches help to light their ceremonial area.

      The World card symbolizes the end of the Fool's travels and is a culmination of all the cards before it. He has worked his way through the Mysteries of the Major Arcana and has found completion. The Fool is shown in the upper left-hand corner as an older and wiser figure now that he has completed his magical journey.
      In the other three corners of the card, we see representations of the gifts he has acquired while on his expedition. In the upper right-hand corner, a golden eagle soars through the sky. The eagle stands for the gifts of intelligence, courage, and confidence. In the lower right, we see an adult male lion. The lion signifies the gifts of strength, passion, and rebirth that the Fool has now obtained. In the lower left-hand corner is a powerful stag. The stag symbolizes pride, poise, and integrity.
      Our wiser and older Fool can now easily put to use all of these skills both in his magic and in his daily life. The Green Man in the center of the World card smiles out at us with foliage surrounding his face and branches crowning him. The branches coming from the top of the Green Man are a nod to the antlers of the horned god of nature.
      For witches, the Green Man is a beautiful and evocative representation, or archetype, of the awesome powers and magic of the natural world.
